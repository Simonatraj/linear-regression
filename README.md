# Linear Regression from Scratch

Welcome to the **Linear Regression from Scratch** project! This repository demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression algorithm using both a Jupyter Notebook and a standalone Python script.

## Overview

Linear regression is a foundational machine learning algorithm often used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This project provides:

- A step-by-step notebook for hands-on exploration.
- A Python script for quick execution and reuse.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (recommended for notebook visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` file)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Simonatraj/linear-regression.git
   cd linear-regression
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open `Linear_regression_algorithm.ipynb` for an interactive walkthrough.

3. **Run the Python Script:**

   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```
   - Follow any console instructions or edit the script with your own data arrays.

## Usage

- **Notebook**: Step through the cells to see data loading, model parameter calculations (slope and intercept), predictions, and result visualization.
- **Script**: Imports data, performs regression, prints results. Adapt it easily for other datasets or integrate in larger projects.

## Example Results

- The notebook will display a scatter plot of the data and the best-fit regression line.
- Output includes regression coefficients (slope, intercept) and evaluation (e.g., mean squared error).
